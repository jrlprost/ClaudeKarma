# ClaudeKarma Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 2026*

## Overview

ClaudeKarma does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. Your usage information stays on your device.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** ClaudeKarma operates entirely locally on your browser.

## How It Works

ClaudeKarma reads your Claude AI usage data directly from claude.ai using your existing browser session. This data:

- Is fetched directly from claude.ai to your browser
- Is stored locally on your device only
- Is never sent to any external servers
- Is never shared with third parties

## Local Storage

The extension stores the following on your device only:

- **Usage data**: Your current session and weekly usage percentages
- **Organization ID**: Your Claude organization identifier (for API requests)
- **Preferences**: Tips page viewed status

This data is stored using Chrome's local storage API and never leaves your device.

## Permissions

ClaudeKarma requires minimal permissions:

- **Host permission (claude.ai)**: To fetch your usage data from Claude's API
- **Storage**: To save usage data and preferences locally
- **Alarms**: To periodically refresh usage data in the background

## Third-Party Services

ClaudeKarma uses **no third-party services, analytics, or tracking**. The only external communication is between your browser and claude.ai (Anthropic's official website) to fetch your usage data.

## Data Security

All data remains in your browser's local storage. We have no servers, no databases, and no way to access your information.

## Changes to This Policy

Any updates to this policy will be reflected in the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.
